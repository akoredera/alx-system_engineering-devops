Alea iacta est ("The die is cast") is a Latin phrase attributed by Suetonius (as iacta alea est) to Julius Caesar on January 10, 49 BC as he led his army across the Rubicon river in Northern Italy. With this step, he entered Italy at the head of his army in defiance of the Senate and began
his long civil war against Pompey and the Optimates. 

The phrase has been adopted in Italian (Il dado è tratto), Romanian (Zarurile au fost aruncate), Spanish (La suerte está echada), French (Les dés sont jetés), Portuguese (Asorte está lançada), Dutch (De teerling is geworpen), German (Der Würfel ist gefallen), Hungarian (A kocka el van vetve) and many other languages to indicate that events have passed a point of no return.

Caesar was said to have borrowed the phrase from Menander, the famous Greek writer of comedy, whom he appreciated more than the Roman playwright Terence.[1][2] The phrase appears in Ἀρρηφόρος (transliterated as Arrephoros, or possibly, The Flute-Girl), as quoted in Deipnosophistae, paragraph 8.[3]
